# Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Feature-selection
This project deals with the use of machine learning to predict changes in stock values as well as we incorporating study on effect of different feature selection in our results, as well as we are introducing the non traditional features like Date with specific mapping function and many stock market anomalies



Our Project mainly focuses on the creating a feed data for tarining of machine learning algorithms 
the indicators are used to achive this are as below

1) SMA - Simple Moving Average
2) EMA - Exponential Moving Average
3) TEMA - Triple Exponential Moving Average
4) AROS - Aroon Oscilator
5) STOS - Stochastic Oscilator
6) RSI - Relative Strength Index
7) PPO - Percentage Price Oscilator
8) MACD - Moving Average Convergence And Divergence
9) OBV - On Balance Volume
