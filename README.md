# Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Feature-selection
This project deals with the use of machine learning to predict changes in stock values as well as incorporates study on effect of different feature selection in prediction.


Aim of this project is to prove that via using the Date and other non-traditional features like Day of the week effect, Month of the year effect and other market anomalies as an feature to predict stock rates, the result will improve notably.


Our Project mainly focuses on the creating a feed data for tarining of machine learning algorithms 
the indicators are used to achive this are as below

1) SMA - Simple Moving Average
2) EMA - Exponential Moving Average
3) TEMA - Triple Exponential Moving Average
4) AROS - Aroon Oscilator
5) STOS - Stochastic Oscilator
6) RSI - Relative Strength Index
7) PPO - Percentage Price Oscilator
8) MACD - Moving Average Convergence And Divergence
9) OBV - On Balance Volume
